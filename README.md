## Getting Started

To use this project, you need to have a Circle account and an API key. If you don't have one already, you can create a new Circle account and generate an API key from the [Circle Developer Dashboard](https://developers.circle.com/dashboard).

## Usage

To start using this project, you can either clone the repository or install it using `npm`:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/circle-apis.git

# Install using npm
npm install circle-apis
```

Once you have installed the package, you can import it in your code:

```javascript
const CircleAPIs = require('circle-apis');
const circle = new CircleAPIs(apiKey, environment);
```

You can then start making API calls using the `circle` object.

## Endpoints

This project supports all Circle APIs, including:

- Payments API
- Wallets API
- Accounts API
- Orders API
- Payouts API
- Transactions API
- Refunds API
- etc.

For a complete list of endpoints and their documentation, please refer to the [Circle API Reference](https://developers.circle.com/docs/api-reference).

## Authentication

To authenticate your API requests, you need to provide your API key as the first parameter when creating a new `CircleAPIs` object. You also need to specify the environment (sandbox or production) as the second parameter.

```javascript
const CircleAPIs = require('circle-apis');
const circle = new CircleAPIs(apiKey, 'sandbox');
```
